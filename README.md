## Shushify

**Shushify** is an LSPosed module for Spotify that automatically mutes audio ads as soon as they start, and restores your volume the moment your music comes back.

No interaction needed — it works silently in the background.

### Patches included
- **Ad Muter** — automatically mutes audio ads and unmutes when music resumes
- **Unlock all other Premium features** - based on v260303 of [xposed spotify](https://github.com/chsbuffer/ReVancedXposed_Spotify)

So ads are still visible, but not audible. [Mutify](https://github.com/teekamsuthar/Mutify/) style directly in Spotify.

### The Impact of Server-Side Consistency Checks


Starting from late January 2026, the server has implemented a new verification logic 
that enforces strict **dual-sync checks** for account attributes and configuration data. 
The server now cross-references your account attributes (such as Subscription Type) and 
core configuration data in real-time. If client-side modifications or suppressed logics are detected, 
the server will immediately forcibly terminate the session.

**To prevent frequent logouts, we have adjusted the patches to prioritize usability. **

**Consequently:**

- Audio and visual ads will now appear.
- Non-functional Download button now visible.

Remember: if you are not paying for the product, **you** are the product.
